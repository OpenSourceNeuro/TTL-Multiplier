# TTL-Multiplier wish list

## Needs 
- Obviously branding on the front-facing panel
- Mounting system on either side (to accomodate different setups)
- A spec for what size barrel plug to use. Took some guess work trial/error.

## Wants
- Reinforced mounting bracket, ideally extending metal plate to all holes in plastic housing -> avoid screwing directly into plastic

## Questions/unknowns
- An ON/OFF switch for every channel may be overkill, and has caused some (preventable user error, but still) headaches in that channels were inadvertently switched off. Perhaps a main switch on the back is sufficient. 
    - Is there any benefit to being able to switch each channel ON/OFF?
    - If so, perhaps DIP switches (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIP_switch) somewhere recessed and discrete so users are less likely to accidentally knock these about.
